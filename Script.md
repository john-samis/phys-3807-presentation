# General Script for Presentation

House the high-level description of the presentation.


## Intro

 - #### TITLE 

 - #### AI USE STATE.
    - AI (chatgpt 5.2) was used to refine script, grammar, generate a few example problems, vis insp. NOT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS, 

        human in loop, was co-written by us, all example problems were solved by us, talk? if not sure 
        
        only refined, tightened, inspiration for visuals with use of GenAi

 - #### [Learning Outcomes]
    Understand the concept of lin. ind., and what and how the Wron. is used to solve and chatract. diff eqs. (?ordinary)
 
 - #### [Asses prior knowledge]:

    #### [Interactive Strategies] Show of hands for all of these topics
    Does everyones remmeber 
        - Vectors vs. scalar
        - Dot product
        - Determinant of a 2x2 matrix
        - derivatives of a function (single var.)
        - ODEs
        - All of the above

    PLANT question here: "How does one do a detereminant of a 2x2 matrix";

## Linear Independence (Command, Visual)

    - Textbook Def.: lin ind. is this. 
        doesnt dep.

    what does that mean, it helps to have a visual, vec
    WHat does it mean when someone says cartesian:
        Coordinate Sys. (Cartesian) "Right-hand, orthogonal coordinate system"

        {SHOW VISUAL OF x,y,z in a cartesian plane}


    These basis vectors of our 3-d space are said to be linearly indepenent of each 

    -> QUESTION TO CLASS: "Does anyone know why this is case."


    Useful tool to measure lin./orthoganilty  ind. is the dot product or inner product

    - show dot product equation, dot vectors, the cosine repr, then it will intake two vecotr and output t scalar of 
        the amount of projection, SHOW VIS OF TWO VECTOR AND PROJ.
        PROJECTON HERE

#### [COMMAND of MATERIAL]

### SOLIDIFY WITH ASSESS/
#### {ex prob.}
    -> 2 EXAMPLE PROBLEM; One visual included foreach, one that is obviously lin. ind. and one that is calculate

            tell class to do take 40 seconds


    if dot product is equal to zero: we can say that those vctor are lin. ind. 

    WHat did everyone find, oh this was blabla, this one was blala





    RELATE BACK TO CARETSIAN, that it follows that all of these three basis vetor dot product are zero, and thus orthogonal and linearly ind.

#### ACTIVAT ENEW KNOWLEDGE, so relate to physics

E&M wave has elec and mag fields, oscillating orthogonal to eachother, and are also both orthogonal to direction of propopagation poynting vector

maybe elliptical if time e field

#### EFFECTIVE TRANSITION TO WONRSKIAN

Vectors are lin. Ind. from dot product.’

WHat about solution sets to diff. Eqs. how do we know these are lin. ind.

Transition to diff eqs.




## Wronskian

    - ODEs, are THIS

    - WHy do we care about solution sets of differential equations that are lin. ind.

    small example: homogenous soln C_1e^x + C_2e^x is our solution. why is this ?bad 
    BECAUSE OF BLA

    So without delving into the derivation of the proper form? we say that 

    y(x) = C_1e^x +C_2xe^x

    relate back to why we care

    This is where the wronskian comes in

    - Textbook Def.: wronskian is this is this. 
        test for lin. dep. of a set of determinant and their derivateives 

        show the linear independance of a set of solutions

    -> SHOW EQUATION OF WRONSKAIN

    THen EXAMPLE PROBLE<M>

    From the problem statement
        - plug into wronskian determinatn, do the determinant, 
        - get the big two integral equation, then say this can be finished later, HINT: yo u ise integration by parts

#### ACTIVATE NEW KNOW. 

Bring back to physics, find some example of a linear const. coeff. ODE



Say some equation of motion.

show that the wronksian can be used to show that it is lin. ind., soln, and why


WHY IS IT USEFUL TO PHYSICS


## Closing Remarks


#### SUMMARY

    - Lin. ind. 
    - wronksian.

    - link back to student exp, prior knowledge
        - builds on vector, determinant, ODEs, derivatives, and these tools comibine to something bla


#### Comment outside of physics, and say hey look at the basics of a vector database; mayb

#### Practice Problem, just pull a wronskian problem, pull ODE from text, tell class to use wronskian.

        Solving this problem will provide to exercissing/testing for linear indepennce and the computation
        of the wonrskian determeintant.
